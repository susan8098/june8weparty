			<p>The two met one fateful night in October 2012. Not to be dramatic, it was actually night time (it was Nuit Blanche) and it was actually fateful as it changed both their lives forever. </p>
			<p>She - a student, an artist extraodinaire and world traveller. He - a mediocre finance professional, aging gracefully(ish) and undisputedly a really good guy.</p>
			<p>The two hit it off right away. Well sort of. The story goes that Dmitry in fact forgot that he met Susan that night. Not to be held against him, as he forgets most things. And Susan wasn’t so much into Andy’s awkward cousin anyway. But soon enough, after a couple more meetings, they were inseparable. To say that the two have a lot in common might be a bit of a stretch. She loves art, theatre,  baking. He loves golf, golf with his cousin Andy, occasional evening of beer and peanuts with his sister…but mostly golf.</p>
			<p>Brunch? They both love brunch!</p>
			<p>But more than brunch, they love each other. They compliment each other and bring out the best in the other. Their love is clear and apparent…very, very apparent to all those around them. I mean really guys, enough is enough!</p>

				<p>Susan grew up all over the place. What a tumbleweed! Her early life has given her much of her zeal for travel, love of art and different cultures. Having been all over the world, she now appreciates the quiet comforts of a stable life. </p>
				<p>She may be young, but don’t confuse that with lack of maturity. No no, this one has all the confidence and strength. She has always been a calming force in the lives of those around her. With such a strong sense of self, she’s danced to the beat of her own drum since she was a little girl. Freak!</p>
				<p>She always knew that the one for her was out there somewhere. And now that she’s found him, she will never have to dance alone again. How these two love to dance…!</p>

				<p>Of a much varied background (he is a Kazakhstan-born Russian Korean), Dmitry often confuses people just simply by being himself. Read that as you may! From a young age he developed a great sense of humour. One that everyone (shockingly) finds funny! </p>
				<p>Dmitry feels comfortable being the centre of attention. Always the life of the party, this one. He is a born leader, entertainer and sometimes unwitting comedian. </p>
				<p>He is his parents’ pride and joy. He is his sister’s inspiration.</p>
				<p>For those who have known him longest and love him most he has always been a bright light.  And we will all willingly admit that since Susan has come into his life, he’s been shining brighter (and louder) than ever! </p>
